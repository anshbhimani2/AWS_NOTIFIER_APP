## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Onboarding**  
   Complete a guided onboarding flow and provide AWS IAM credentials with SNS permissions.

2. **Region & Platform Application ARN**  
   Select an AWS region and provide the SNS **Platform Application ARN** associated with your Firebase project.

3. **Device Registration**  
   The app retrieves an FCM token and creates an SNS platform endpoint for your device.

4. **Topic Management**  
   View, create, refresh, or delete SNS topics in the selected region.

5. **Subscriptions**  
   Subscribe to any topic with a single tap to start receiving push notifications instantly.

6. **Notification History**  
   Alerts are stored locally and automatically cleaned up based on retention settings.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose (Onboarding), ViewBinding (Dashboard)  
- **Architecture:** MVVM  
- **AWS SDK:** AWS SDK for Kotlin (SNS, STS, EC2)  
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)  
- **Database:** Room  
- **Security:** EncryptedSharedPreferences  

---

## 🔐 Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account  
- A Firebase project linked to the Android app  

---

### 1️⃣ IAM User Setup

Create an IAM user with **programmatic access** and attach a policy with the following minimum permissions:

sns:ListTopics
sns:CreateTopic
sns:DeleteTopic
sns:Subscribe
sns:Unsubscribe
sns:CreatePlatformEndpoint
sns:GetEndpointAttributes
sns:SetEndpointAttributes



⚠️ **Do not use root credentials.** Grant only the permissions required.

---

### 2️⃣ Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project  
2. Add your Android app  
3. Download `google-services.json`  
4. Place it in the `app/` directory  

---

### 3️⃣ AWS SNS Platform Application

1. Open the AWS SNS Console  
2. Create a **Platform Application**  
3. Select **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**  
4. Provide your FCM Server Key  
5. Copy the **Platform Application ARN**  
6. Enter this ARN during onboarding for each region  

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download `AWS_SNS_NOTIFIER_1.0.0.apk` from **Releases → Assets**  
2. Install the APK on your Android device  
3. Allow installation from unknown sources if prompted  
4. Launch the app and complete onboarding

## Why This App Exists

AWS Budget alerts are critical for monitoring costs, but the default notification options (email, SMS) have limitations:

- **Email:** Slow and easy to miss.  
- **SMS:** Paid service.  
- **SNS:** Free, AWS-native, but not directly mobile-friendly.  

This app fills the gap by bridging **AWS SNS → Android push notifications via FCM**.

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. AWS Credentials in the App
- Users provide their **own AWS Access Key and Secret Key**.  
- No backend or sign-up required, allowing **independent use**.  
- ⚠️ **Security:** Create IAM users with **minimal SNS permissions** for safety.

### 2. Android-only Platform
- Targeting Android ensures **immediate mobile notifications**.  
- Focused on personal use for simplicity and reliability.

### 3. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- FCM is used to **deliver push notifications** reliably on Android.  
- Handles token management, registration, and delivery without extra complexity.

### 4. Per-topic Subscriptions
- Users **choose which topics to subscribe to**, avoiding notification overload.  
- Supports multiple use cases: budgets, development, or other alerts.

### 5. Multi-region Support
- AWS SNS topics are **region-scoped**, and the app supports multiple regions.  
- Enables users to monitor alerts across different projects and locations.

### 6. Full SNS Management
- Users can **list, create, delete, and subscribe to topics** directly in the app.  
- Adds convenience and eliminates the need to use AWS Console.

### 7. Independent, Self-contained
- No backend or SMS costs required.  
- Works like a **mobile AWS SNS client**, giving users **full control** over notifications.

---

## Use Case Example

**AWS Budget Alerts:**  
- Set thresholds in AWS Budgets.  
- When a threshold is exceeded, AWS publishes a notification to an SNS topic.  
- This app subscribes to that topic and **delivers a push notification to your Android device instantly**.
